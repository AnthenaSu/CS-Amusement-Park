# CS-Amusement-Park
CS Amusement Park is a C command-line simulator that manages a theme park using linked lists: rides are stored in a park list, each ride owns a visitor queue, and roaming visitors live in a separate list. Supports adding/inserting rides, queue ops, operating/merging/splitting/shutdown, plus tick-based scheduled commands.
